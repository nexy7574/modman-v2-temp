# ModMan v2

This is the second iteration of the original modman project.
ModMan v1 was cobbled together in a haste in order to get a working mod manager for a friend's minecraft server, as I
was sick of having outdated mods, and was aware of the hassle required in order to update the bulk of mods in a server.

ModMan v2 aims to be more complete as a package manager, similar to the likes of apt/rpm/yay, but for minecraft mods.
It will also feature a completely separate API library, rather than the semi-integrated one from v1, which will allow
for easier integration into other projects.
